Welcome to the repository for my traffic accident data analysis project, completed during my data science internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset containing traffic accident records.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to understand patterns and trends, identify accident hotspots, and provide actionable insights that can help in enhancing road safety measures.

## Key Findings

- **City-wise Distribution**: Miami is the city with the most number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg have the least.
- **State-wise Distribution**: California has the highest number of accidents, whereas South Dakota has the least.
- **Yearly Trends**: The year 2021 saw the highest number of accidents.
- **Severity Levels**: Most accidents were classified at severity level 2.
- **Weather Conditions**: The majority of accidents occurred under fair weather conditions.
- **Time of Day**: Most accidents happened in the morning.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights key patterns in traffic accident data, such as high accident rates in densely populated areas like Miami and California, and a significant number of accidents occurring under fair weather conditions in the morning. These insights can inform road safety initiatives and policy decisions to reduce accidents and improve public safety.
